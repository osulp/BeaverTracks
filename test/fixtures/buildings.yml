  name: Benton Hall
  description: ! "The first cornerstone was laid for the new Administration Building
    on Corvallis’ “College Hill” in 1887 - and our university was born. Known as Benton
    Hall since 1947, the first building on campus was completed in 1888, with the
    college moved in by the end of 1889.\r\n\r\nBenton Hall has served the university
    in many capacities. It originally housed all college’s classrooms, administrative
    offices, and lab space. Though you would have found the library there until 1918
    and the President’s Office until 1923, today the melodies drifting from open windows
    are evidence of the resident department since 1916 – the Music Department!"

  name: Kidder Hall
  description: ! "When space in Benton Hall was inadequate for the library collection,
    administrators looked to John Bennes to design a new building. Originally named
    “The Library” when it opened in 1918, the space quickly filled with books, offices,
    and classrooms. It expanded again in 1940 with the addition of the west wing,
    and again in 1954 with the in-filling the reading rooms with an additional floor.
    The space still wasn’t enough, and in 1962 the college began construction on a
    new building.\r\n\r\nWhen the new library building opened in 1964, the old library
    building was renamed Kidder Hall in after Ida Kidder, the college’s first professional
    librarian."

  name: Pharmacy Building
  description: ! "The Pharmacy building opened in 1924 and has seen little change
    since then. Demand for space led to an addition in 1966 and at one time the 2nd
    floor included a model drug store, which was described in a pharmacy trade magazine
    of the time as providing “a laboratory for instruction in store arrangement, showcase
    and window decorating and practical salesmanship of drugs and druggists’ sundries.”\r\n\r\nIt
    has been used exclusively by the College of Pharmacy. "
